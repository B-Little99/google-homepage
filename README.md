This project was to reconstruct the Google homepage, testing my knowledge on HTML and CSS.

The project showed me a lot about the placement, styling and alignment of elements.

Other skills I developed and utilised include:

  Git/GitHub practical usage - I had to create a repository with lots of git add and commit cycles in addition to the git push / pull

  Debugging - I had to review my own code to find errors and make sure that I had clean code

  Researching - If I was unsure of something I had to do what all developers do... research to find an appropriate fix!
  
  Developer tools - Using the tools at my disposal to help me diagnose issues.
